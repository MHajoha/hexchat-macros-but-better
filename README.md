# Macros But Better
Adds customizable commands for use while dispatching in the Fuel Rats.
Script written in Python3 for [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) IRC client.
>Because of HexChat restrictions, a <i>standard</i> Python installation of the same architecture as your HexChat installation is required.

Migrated from [Hexchat Addons](https://github.com/MHajoha/hexchat-addons). Look there for previous commit history.

## Installation
After downloading the script, you can just navigate to it in HexChat (HexChat -> Load Plugin or Script...) and load it.
If you want it to be loaded when you start HexChat, you need to throw it into
* ~/.config/hexchat/addons/ on Linux
* %APPDATA%\HexChat\addons\ on Windows
